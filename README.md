# Dry Beans Classifcation Problem

## Overview

This machine learning project focuses on the classification of dry beans using the Dry Bean Dataset, which can be accessed [here]([https://website-name.com](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset)). 
The dataset contains a comprehensive set of features that describe various attributes of dry beans, making it an ideal candidate for classification tasks.

##Â Project Highlights
- Utilized state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to classify dry beans into multiple categories.
- Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset to ensure data quality and reliability.
- Experimented with various machine learning algorithms and fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal model performance.
- Evaluated model performance using relevant metrics and visualized results for insights.
- The project aims to assist in the accurate and efficient sorting of dry beans, which has practical applications in agriculture and food processing industries.
